# My fork of the simple [suckless terminal (st)](https://st.suckless.org/)

## Unique features (using dmenu)

+ **follow urls** by pressing `alt-l`
+ **copy urls** in the same way with `alt-y`
+ **copy the output of commands** with `alt-o`
+ *weechat commands* with `alt-x`

## Bindings for

+ **scrollback** with `alt-↑/↓` or `alt-pageup/down` or `shift` while scrolling the mouse
+ OR **vim-bindings**: scroll up/down in history with `alt-k` and `alt-j`. Faster with `alt-u`/`alt-d`.
+ **zoom/change font size**: same bindings as above, but holding down shift as well. `alt-home` returns to default
+ **copy text** with `alt-c`, **paste** is `alt-v` or `shift-insert`

## Pretty stuff

+ Compatibility with `Xresources` and `pywal` for dynamic colors.
+ Default [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colors otherwise.
+ Transparency/alpha, which is also adjustable from your `Xresources`.
+ Default font is system "mono" at 14pt, meaning the font will match your system font.

## Notes on Emojis and Special Characters

If st crashes when viewing emojis, install [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/) from the AUR.

Note that some special characters may appear truncated if too wide. You might want to manually set your prefered emoji/special character font to a lower size in the `config.h` file to avoid this. By default, JoyPixels is used at a smaller size than the usual text.
